abstract: "Numerous psychrophiles inhabit the cold environments that are prevalent across the global biosphere. The adaptation of psychrophiles to cold conditions has been widely studied in strains from the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota and the bacterial class Gamma-proteobacteria. However, given the vast diversity of microorganisms in cold environments, many microbial lineages with potentially unique cold-adaptation strategies remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the cold responses of the Antarctic strain Poseidonibacter antarcticus SM1702(T), a cold-adapted bacterium belonging to the class Epsilon-proteobacteria within the phylum Campylobacterota. Proteomic analysis revealed that this strain responds to low temperatures by overexpressing proteins involved in energy production and amino acid transport. Experimental results confirmed that intracellular ATP concentrations increased at low temperatures compared to higher temperatures. Low temperatures significantly reduced the strain's amino acid absorption rates, a condition that was mitigated by increased expression of membrane transporters. We propose that the impairment of membrane protein function due to low temperatures is the primary factor affecting cell growth. As a result, the strain enhances ATP synthesis and upregulates membrane transporter expression to counteract cold stress. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cold adaptation strategies in psychrophiles."
