Post-transcriptional regulation (PTR) is an important regulatory step in protein expression and plays a significant role in the physiological functions of various organisms. Post-transcriptional regulation includes RNA modifications and RNA degradation. However, I am particularly focused on a class of regulatory non-coding RNAsâ€”small RNAs (sRNAs). sRNAs are typically 50-500 nucleotides long and consist of three basic parts: mRNA target-binding sites, RNA-binding protein binding sites, and a stem-loop structure that can block translation.

Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308 is a strain commonly found in polar environments, with unique physiological mechanisms such as cold adaptation and the production of indigodine. The laboratory has discovered many novel sRNAs in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308 and demonstrated that these sRNAs play important roles in this organism. However, there has not yet been a complete mining and identification of all sRNAs in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308. Therefore, I am using comparative genomics and transcriptomics to systematically and comprehensively predict the sRNAs in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308. Furthermore, I am employing AI-based methods to predict the structure and targets of putative sRNAs. The application of bioinformatics will greatly help us understand how sRNAs function in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308.

At the same time, based on the sRNAs I have surveyed, we also hope to synthesize them artificially and deliver them into Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308 to achieve artificial post-transcriptional regulatory modulation. Here, we use ell-penetrating peptides (CPP) as carriers for the sRNA cargo to deliver the synthesized sRNA into Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308 and achieve targeted regulation.
