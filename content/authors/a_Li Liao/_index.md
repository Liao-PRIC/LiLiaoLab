I am a scientist from Polar Research Institute of China. My research broad interests include:
1. Microbial Adaptation and Evolution: uncovering the evolved strategies by microbes in the polar regions to survive extreme environments;
2. Polar Microbes and Climate Change: understanding the impacts of climate change on microbes in the polar regions, as well as microbial responses to climate and environmental changes;
3. Microbial Resources and Biotechnology: exploring novel microbial species, genetic materials and products.
Welcome postdoc, perspective grad students and interns who share my interests to join my lab!
