   abstract = {Small RNAs (sRNAs) play a very important role in gene regulation at the posttranscriptional level. However, sRNAs from nonmodel microorganisms, extremophiles in particular, have been rarely explored. We discovered a putative sRNA, termed Pf1 sRNA, in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea BSW20308 isolated from the polar regions in our previous work. In this study, we identified the sRNA and investigated its regulatory role in gene expression under different temperatures. Pf1 sRNA was confirmed to be a new member of the CsrB family but has little sequence similarity with Escherichia coli CsrB. However, Pf1 sRNA was able to bind to CsrA from E. coli and P. fuliginea BSW20308 to regulate glycogen synthesis. The Pf1 sRNA knockout strain (ΔPf1) affected motility, fitness, and global gene expression in transcriptomes and proteomes at 4°C and 32°C. Genes related to carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, salinity tolerance, antibiotic resistance, oxidative stress, motility, chemotaxis, biofilm, and secretion systems were differentially expressed in the wild-type strain and the ΔPf1 mutant. Our study suggested that Pf1 sRNA might play an important role in response to environmental changes by regulating global gene expression. Specific targets of the Pf1 sRNA-CsrA system were tentatively proposed, such as genes involved in the type VI secretion system, TonB-dependent receptors, and response regulators, but most of them have an unknown function. Since this is the first study of CsrB family sRNA in Pseudoalteromonas and microbes from the polar regions, it provides a novel insight at the posttranscriptional level into the responses and adaptation to temperature changes in bacteria from extreme environments. This study also sheds light on the evolution of sRNA in extreme environments and expands the bacterial sRNA database. IMPORTANCE Previous research on microbial temperature adaptation has focused primarily on functional genes, with little attention paid to posttranscriptional regulation. Small RNAs, the major posttranscriptional modulators of gene expression, are greatly underexplored, especially in nonpathogenic and nonmodel microorganisms. In this study, we verified the first Csr sRNA, named Pf1 sRNA, from Pseudoalteromonas, a model genus for studying cold adaptation. We revealed that Pf1 sRNA played an important role in global regulation and was indispensable in improving fitness. This study provided us a comprehensive view of sRNAs from Pseudoalteromonas and expanded our understanding of bacterial sRNAs from extreme environments.},
